# console-note
This is an old project that i've been wishing to make for a minute ,  already , is basically like a nano or vim with the funtionality of a notepad which is basically useful just to save quick notes i developed this version mainly for linux but as it is under .Net  Freamwork it could easyly be exported to other operating systems  plus im lastly adding some fun feacures like encrypting the notes and also using password to be able to have access to the data inside it.
